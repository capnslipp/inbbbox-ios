With Inbbbox you can discover excellent visual works from Dribbble, the global directory for digital design.
If you want to grab a copy for yourself just go straight to [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/inbbbox/id1101252506). However, if you are interested in the core of Inbbbox, check out [Configuration](#configuration) section. Note that Dribbble account is necessary for using the app.

We at Netguru strongly believe in open-source software. Inbbbox isn’t our only project repo where you can find the app’s full source code. Explore other [open source projects](https://www.netguru.co/opensource) created by our team.

## Configuration

### Tools & requirements

* Xcode 7.2.1 with iOS 9.2 SDK
* Carthage 0.11 or newer
* CocoaPods 0.39 or newer
* RVM (recommended)
* Bundler

### Instructions

1. Clone repo at `https://github.com/netguru/inbbbox-ios.git`
2. Within Terminal navigate to `inbbbox-ios` directory
3. Type `bundle install`
4. Type `carthage bootstrap`
5. Type `bundle exec pod install`

    You will see `CocoaPods-Keys has detected a keys mismatch for your setup. What is the key for ClientID`. Fear not! This is how Inbbbox authenticates with Dribbble API to fetch all data! Go to `https://dribbble.com/account/applications/` to create your own application. After that you should have `ClientID`, `ClientSecret` and `ClientAccessToken`. After providing `ClientID` you will be asked for other keys. We are using `cocoapods-keys` to store them securely.

    As an alternative way of storing keys, you can add them to `.env` file to root directory of project. All required keys can be found in `.env.required` file, so all you need to do is to copy them to `.env` file and provide your values.

    During pod installation, `cocoapods-keys` will actually search for keys in `.env` file in the first place. Optional keys can be found in `.env.optional`, but are not required for project setup.

6. You are good to go! Just open `Inbbbox.xcworkspace`. In case of any problems don't hesitate to contact with us!
